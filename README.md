# Flask-RMS

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many restaurants implementing social distancing measures 
between people. Our web application aims to resolve this issue by virtualizing these 
interactions. Customers are able to pay for their meal online and receive 
the bill via their email, thereby minimizing person to person interaction. Such a system can be 
relatively quick to implement within the restaurant, enhance the safety of the customers and staff 
as well make the ordering process quicker and more efficient.
