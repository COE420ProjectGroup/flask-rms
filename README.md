# Flask-RMS

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many restaurants implementing social distancing measures 
between people. This includes maintaining a minimum distance of 6 feet and minimizing the 
amount of time people are in contact with each other. Most restaurants can implement the 6 feet 
rule by just decreasing the number of tables and increasing the spacing between them. However, 
there always exists extended periods of contact between the customers and the waiter and 
between the waiter and chefs. Our web application aims to resolve this issue by virtualizing these 
interactions. Through this, customers are able to order items from the menu by using a tablet 
device stationed at each individual table. The chefs directly get the order, prepare it and send it 
back to the customer. Furthermore, customers are able to pay for their meal online and receive 
the bill via their email, thereby minimizing person to person interaction. Such a system can be 
relatively quick to implement within the restaurant, enhance the safety of the customers and staff 
as well make the ordering process quicker and more efficient.
